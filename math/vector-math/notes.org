* Dot product of two vectors
** The dot product of two vectors:
   \[\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}=\parallel\vec{A}\parallel \parallel\vec{B}\parallel\cos{\theta}\]
   The \[\parallel\vec{A}\parallel\] means the length of said vector

   For unit vectors, this is pretty easy. Since the length of both vectors is 1, that means that the dot product of any two unit vectors is \[\cos\theta\]
