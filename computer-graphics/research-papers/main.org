** [[http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ReflectanceModel/paper.pdf][A Reflectance Model for Computer Graphics - Robert L. Cook, Kenneth E. Torrance]]
*** This paper presents a reflectance model that is more general than previous models - it is based on geometrical optics
**** The basis of the model reflectance definition that relates the brightness of an object to the intensity and size of each light source that illuminates it
**** The model predicts the directional distribution and spectral composition of the reflected light
**** A procedure is described for calculating red, green, and blue (RGB) values from the spectral energy distribution
**** The new reflectance model is then applied to the simulation of a metal and a plastic, with an explanation of why images rendered with previous models often look plastic, and how this plastic appearance can be avoided
*** Energy vs. Intensity
**** See [[http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/SegwayEd/lessons/light/measure3.html][here]] for a simple example of the difference between energy and intensity
*** [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SolidAngle.html][Solid angle]]
**** See [[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/integrating-multivariable-functions/double-integrals-topic/v/double-integral-1][this]] video (and the following) for an explanation of double integrals
**** See [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRwSZmJI87M][this]] video for an explanation of BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) and a short example of solid angles
     \[d\omega_i\] = area of the differential solid angle
*** Ambient light vs. Direct light
**** What is ambient light?
     Ambient light is all light received by an object that is not received directly from a light
